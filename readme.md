Wi-Fi Monitor v0.2.1 is a simple desktop application written in Python with a graphical user interface (PyQt5), designed for automatic monitoring and maintaining connection to a selected Wi-Fi network on Windows.
Wi-Fi Monitor continuously tracks the availability of the specified Wi-Fi network, ensures a stable connection to it, and verifies internet access.
The program is particularly useful in areas with unstable Wi-Fi signals (for example, in rural locations or zones with weak coverage) — it automatically attempts to reconnect when the connection is lost.
How to Use:
On first launch, enter the SSID (network name) and password. Then, use the buttons in the interface to start/stop monitoring and clear the event log.
